<p>Calls from your mobile phone will appear as your office phone in Caller ID. Due to the fact that the voice signal is broken up into data packets as an IP call, topped the internet, and reassembled at its location (type of like a Star Trek transporter), instead of binding a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, long-distance calls are cheaper through VoIP-- another cost savings point.
